For me, it felt like I was drowning when first encountering AWS's large amount of document. There was a super long learning curve for me to know Amplify(i.e. 1 weeks's whole day exploration simply to deploy example code app.js) . Hope this process is a little bit shorted for you.


# Backend:

## 1. install AWS CLI

https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install#install-the-amplify-cli 
    
    e.g. 
    linux&mac: `sudo npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`
    
    windows: `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli --unsafe-perm=true`    
                //--unsafe-perm=true is not necessary 
                //https://www.centennialsoftwaresolutions.com/post/install-and-configure-the-aws-amplify-cli-on-windows-7


    common error for windows users here
    amplify' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
    run `amplify -v` `node -v` `npm -v` and check they are up-to-date
    run `echo %path:;=&echo.%` and check C:\Users\pfefferz\AppData\Roaming\npm (or something like it) is listed in your path. 


  
## 2. pull the backend from cloud       X

e.g. `amplify pull --appId d1n4bsjl3se5pf --envName dev`
    
         `amplify configure`

    common mistake here:
    
        `amplify init` is for creating a new Amplify APP. You do not need to run it in our case when you already have a project.
        
        `amplify configure` needs to be run after `amplify pull` or `amplify init`. Or you will get the error "You are not working inside a valid amplify project"

## 3. try make a small change on backend and push to cloud    X

    e.g. `amplify push`   << It could take a long time

    rule here: If you feel uncertain, don't do it!!!
    
    I used to follow my instinct and choose which seems reasonable, and it ruins everything that I have to build from scratch. 


# Frontend

## 1. GraphQL x Amplify

    Tutorial:
      - Start with this tutorial first: https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/data-model/q/integration/js
            My updates in Comment-box/CommentApp.js is mainly from this
      - Then this one（with code example for unconnected table）: https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/advanced-workflows/q/platform/js#complex-objects
            My notes for this ⬆️ tutorial：  GraphQLDemo.js and GraphQLConfiguration.js
      - Then you may refer to Code example for connected table: https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql-transformer/overview

    Example code change for adding a lesson
    
        https://github.com/WorkBuddy613/ManageCourses/pull/1/files  AddLessons.js AddIntroduction.js
        
    Connected table(GraphQL.schema): 
    
        https://github.com/WorkBuddy613/ManageCourses/blob/withBackend/amplify/backend/api/managecourses/schema.graphql
        
    //Please note that all code under src/graphql/* are automatically generated by AWS

## 2. what should be see in DynamoDB table

    ManageCourses - Backend environments - API - CourseTable - View - Items

## 3. Amplify Auth

    Tutorial
      - https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js

    Example code change for getting current user
      - comment-box: https://github.com/WorkBuddy613/Comment-box/blob/main/src/CommentInput.js#L11
      - Course: userID as an attribute
    
## 4. About the code:
    - Add Course button will call createCourse()
    - Announcement, lesson, introduction, syllabus Pages needs to know currentCourseID
    - Make sure whether using Publish Time or createdAt
    - Optional: a `confirm` or `cancel` button at the bottom of the page to confirm creating a new course(Also check if syllabus, course title is null etc)
